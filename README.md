# CodeClauseInternship_PriceRecommendation
I worked on Price recommendation systems for online sellers which are advanced tools designed to help e-commerce businesses determine optimal product prices.
# Price Recommendation for Online Sellers
Price recommendation systems are essential for e-commerce businesses looking to stay competitive, increase sales, and maximize profits. These systems leverage data-driven insights and advanced algorithms to suggest product prices that align with market demand, customer behavior, and business objectives.
# Benefits:
- Increased Revenue: By setting optimal prices, online sellers can increase sales and revenue. Price recommendation systems can identify opportunities to capture additional market share.
- Improved Margins: These systems help maintain healthy profit margins by recommending prices that maximize profitability without overpricing products.
- Competitive Advantage: Staying competitive in the online marketplace is essential. Price recommendations allow sellers to adjust to competitor pricing in real-time.
- Efficiency: Automating pricing decisions saves time and resources. Sellers can focus on other aspects of their business while the system handles pricing.
- Data-Driven Insights: Price recommendation systems provide valuable insights into customer behavior, market trends, and product performance, helping sellers make informed decisions.
  # Libraries used
  - pandas
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - scikit-learn
Components of Price Recommendation for Online Sellers are as follows:
1. Data Collection and Preprocessing:
- Gather historical sales data, including product prices, sales volumes, and customer behavior.
Collect data on competitor pricing and market trends.
- Preprocess and clean the data, handling missing values and outliers.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Analyze the collected data to gain insights into customer behavior, product demand, and market trends.
- Visualize data patterns and correlations.
3. Data Preparation:
- Feature engineering: Create relevant features such as time-based features, customer segments, and price elasticity.
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
4. Algorithm Selection:
- Consider regression-based models and machine learning techniques.
5. Model Analysis:
- The Random Forest Regressor is a machine learning algorithm that belongs to the ensemble learning family. It is used for regression tasks, which involve predicting a continuous numerical value rather than a categorical label.
- For regression tasks, the final prediction made by the Random Forest Regressor is often the average (mean) or median of the predictions from individual decision trees.
- Lasso regression, or L1 regularization, is a linear regression technique that is used for both regression and feature selection. It helps in reducing the complexity of the regression model by penalizing the absolute values of the coefficients.
- Lasso regression is a valuable tool for both regression analysis and feature selection. It helps in building simpler and more interpretable models while handling multicollinearity and preventing overfitting.
# Conclusion
Price recommendation systems are invaluable tools for online sellers looking to thrive in a competitive e-commerce landscape. By leveraging data and advanced algorithms, these systems empower businesses to make data-driven pricing decisions that maximize revenue, profitability, and customer satisfaction.
